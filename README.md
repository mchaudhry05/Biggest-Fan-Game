# The Biggest Fan Game 

The Biggest Fan Game is a fun interactive quiz to prove if you are the artist's biggest fan. The quiz is made up of three levels in the first level you have to guess which song appears on the album shown. In the second level, you have to guess the name of the song from which the lyric is from. Lastly, a snippet of a song plays and you have to guess the name of the song. After the you reach the end you can enter your name on the leaderboard. 

# Inspiration for Project/About the project 

I'm a huge music fan and I decided to make this artist quiz app inspired by theraptest.com. The web application currently features only Drake, but I plan to add more artists. The web application is built using ReactJS and Firebase as a backend for the leadership board. 

# Where can I play/see the game? 

The game is actually live at biggest-fan.web.app, however it is not yet complete this is just the first playable verison. 

# What are you planning on adding to it? 

Firstly, I want to add more levels to the game. Next I want to add the Spotify API to get the songs so that they aren't hardcoded in the game. I also want to upgrade the point system so that way you can get more points if you answer a question more quickly.
